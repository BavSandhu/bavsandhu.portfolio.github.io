              gain a deeper understanding of their behaviours towards remote

              online lectures, we thought we could use it as a way students can
              use their phones as an asset rather than a distraction.

              > The COVID-19 pandemic caused many academic institutions to
              suddenly shift to a new learning environment mid-semester. As
              online learning is heavily operated through technology and on
              technical devices such as a student's computer, it can cause
              communication overload. This essentially means that it can make it
              difficult for users to remain concentrated and can negatively
              impact work efficiency, accuracy and overall performance. An
              article on student's perceptions about online learning states, ‚Äúin
              online learning, where computer-mediated communication is heavily
              relied on, interruptions caused by communication overload are more
              likely to happen and can occur in various forms, such as emails or
              messages sent by instructors, updated announcements in the online
              learning system, or even the reminders of the assignment deadline‚Äù
              (Conrad et al., 2022). In another study conducted on student's
              responses to abrupt online learning, we found research that
              states, ‚Äúafter the transition, the resources with the greatest
              decrease were student-organized study groups, peer-led team
              learning groups, and review sessions‚Äù (Jeffery et al., 2020). The
              aim with our mobile application, Class+, was to help smooth their
              transition to this new environment by providing them with
              resources and ways to increase their motivation, engagement and
              overall participation; improving their work efficiency, accuracy,
              and performance. The reason behind our decision to target
              university students as our core users was because when the
              pandemic first began, they had to transition and adjust to this
              new learning environment in the middle of their academic year. Not
              to mention, students transitioning from high school course loads
              were also suddenly thrown into a university setting that was also
              learning to adapt to the new changes/environment. It can be argued
              that as new students weren't as familiar with the resources
              available to them, it made it even more difficult for them to
              access through remote means.
